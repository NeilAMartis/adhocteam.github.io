        <h2>Designer</h2>
        <p>Location: <b>DC, Baltimore, or Anytown, USA</b></p>
        <p>We are looking for civic-minded designers with great design skills and coding chops to help us solve big problems. Since we focus on small teams, we need for designers who are self-starters. That means we need more than just shiny UI.</p>

        <p>We need great UX, accessibility and the latest responsive design techniques. We also look for designers that like to get their hands dirty: experience with HTML and CSS are required, and knowledge of one or more typical web frameworks is solid gold.</p>
