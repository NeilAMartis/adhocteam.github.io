Ad Hoc is a small software engineering company that came out of the
successful effort to rescue HealthCare.gov after its disastrous
initial launch.

Ad Hoc is focused on delivering and operating fast, stable, and
well-designed services on behalf of U.S. federal and state government
that enables agencies to provide transactional and informational
services to consumers. We do this by bringing people from startups and
successful private sector technology companies to these problems,
collaborating closely with government partners to deliver software that
actually works.

### The HealthCare.gov rescue

Following the initial launch of HealthCare.gov in 2013, the White
House assembled a team of top technology talent from outside of
government, to assess what was wrong and come up with a plan to fix
it.

Greg and Paul, Ad Hoc's cofounders and principals, were part of that
original group, known as the <em>ad hoc team</em>, that went in and worked
along side those who had built HealthCare.gov. Through their expert
leadership and effort, they stablized the site and ensured that
millions of Americans were able to get affordable health coverage.   <a href="./healthcare.gov-rescue.html">Read more on the rescue of HealthCare.gov</a>.
