        <h2>About Ad Hoc</h2>
        <p>
          Ad Hoc is a small software engineering company that came out of the
          successful effort to rescue HealthCare.gov after its disastrous
          initial launch.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ad Hoc is focused on delivering and operating fast, stable, and
          well-designed services on behalf of U.S. federal and state government
          that enables agencies to provide transactional and informational
          services to consumers. We do this by bringing people from startups and
          successful private sector technology companies to these problems,
          collaborating closely with government partners to deliver software that
          actually works.
        </p>

        <h3>The HealthCare.gov rescue</h3>
        <p>
          Following the initial launch of HealthCare.gov in 2013, the White
          House assembled a team of top technology talent from outside of
          government, to assess what was wrong and come up with a plan to fix
          it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Greg and Paul, Ad Hoc's cofounders and principals, were part of that
          original group, known as the <em>ad hoc team</em>, that went in and worked
          along side those who had built HealthCare.gov. Through their expert
          leadership and effort, they stablized the site and ensured that
          millions of Americans were able to get affordable health coverage.   <a href="./healthcare.gov-rescue.html">Read more on the rescue of HealthCare.gov</a>.
