        <p>
          In the days following the initial launch of HealthCare.gov in the fall
          of 2013, the White House, under the direction of U.S. Chief Technology
          Officer Todd Park, assembled a team of top engineering talent from
          outside of government, including software developers, designers, and
          operations experts who had worked in Silicon Valley and technology
          startups around the country. Crucially, they all had experience
          delivering high-quality consumer experiences and operating
          high-traffic websites, exactly the expertise needed to run a site like
          HealthCare.gov.
        </p>

        <p>
          Greg Gershman and Paul Smith, who would eventually go on to found Ad
          Hoc LLC, were part of that original group. Known as the "ad hoc team",
          the group went in among the contractors and government officials who
          had built HealthCare.gov. The team assessed the situation, delivered
          specific and actionable recommendations, and melded in with existing
          teams to provide leadership and guidance in service of righting the
          ship and turning HealthCare.gov around, so that it would be able to
          achieve its goal of signing up millions of Americans with health
          insurance coverage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through a concerted effort that involved long hours and constant
          focus, by the end of 2013, a mere two-and-a-half months after arriving
          on site, the team had helped bring HealthCare.gov, a site that
          enrolled a mere 6 people on its launch day, to the point where it
          could enroll hundreds of thousands of Americans each day in affordable
          health coverage, and the organization and processes it established
          during the rescue put it well on its way to becoming a stable part of
          the American welfare system.
        </p>

        <p>A fuller retelling of the rescue of HealthCare.gov can be read in the Time
          magazine story by Steven Brill,

          Team</a>".

        <h3>The aftermath</h3>

        <p>
          The near-fatal launch of HealthCare.gov was a wake-up call for many
          who cared about the efficient and effective delivery of technology
          services for government.
        </p>

        <p>
          HealthCare.gov was not a freak occurrance. Technology in the federal
          government, and especially systems that deliver important services to
          people, has long-suffered, with most major agency projects failing,
          either behind schedule, over budget, or simply not working.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">U.S. Digital Services
          Playbook</a>, and
          the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">United
          States Digital Service</a>, or USDS, came directly out of the
          HealthCare.gov rescue, with a goal of institutionalizing what the "ad
          hoc team" did that worked so successfully.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ad Hoc LLC complements the USDS mission, along
          with <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>
          and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>: all
          part of a "rebel alliance" that's reforming the way technology is
          developed and delivered in federal, state, and local government, by
          infusing the public sector with private sector talent.
