        <h2>Developer</h2>

        <p>Location: <b>DC, Baltimore, or Anytown, USA</b></p>
        <p>Are you a software engineer interested in working on problems that potentially impact millions of Americans? We&rsquo;re looking for developers with solid experience in developing web-based applications and systems.</p>

        <p>We encourage our teams to select the technology that works best for them. One of our projects is a Go app that serves JSON over HTTP; another is a Rails app that makes creating forms simple for non-technical users. We&rsquo;re looking for driven, creative, and passionate engineers who love solving challenging technical problems and want their work to make a difference.</p>
