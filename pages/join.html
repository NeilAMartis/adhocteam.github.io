            <p>If you have a background in product development, user experience design, or software development, and also love to shape and guide a product from idea to implementation, the Lead Developer position is for you. As a Lead Developer, you will be responsible for directing and influencing product design, development, and architecture. You will work closely with a small team of developers and designers (usually 2-5 people) to plan and prioritize features, and work closely with our public sector clients to understand their needs and involve them in the product development process. If you're technical but also love to direct a product as it grows, this position is for you.</p>
