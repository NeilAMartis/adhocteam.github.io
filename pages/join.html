        <h4><a name="developer">Developer</a></h4>
        <p>Are you a software engineer interested in working on problems that potentially impact millions of Americans? We're looking for developers with solid experience in developing web-based applications and systems. We encourage our teams to select the technology that works best for them. One of our projects is a Go app that serves JSON over HTTP; another is a Rails app that makes creating forms simple for non-technical users. We're looking for driven, creative, and passionate engineers who love solving challenging technical problems and want their work to make a difference.</p>

        <h4><a name="designer">Designer</a></h4>
        <p>We are looking for civic-minded designers with great design skills and coding chops to help us solve big problems. Since we focus on small teams, we need for designers who are self-starters. That means we need more than just shiny UI. We need great UX, accessibility and the latest responsive design techniques. We also look for designers that like to get their hands dirty: experience with HTML and CSS are required, and knowledge of one or more typical web frameworks is solid gold.</p>
