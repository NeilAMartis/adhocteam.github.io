<h3>Dmitry Kachaev</h3>

<p>Arlington, VA</p>

<p>As a kid I made holes in punch cards on ES EVM , it produced scary alarm sound when I was causing stack overflow by randomly pressing buttons on terminal - that was my first intro into computers. I started programing later in high school, and never stopped since then. Books like Algorithms+Data Structures=Programs and Mythical Man Month were defining for me as I was learning about programming. I like to code. I used to run technology innovation lab for DC Government and also recently served as Presidential Innovation Fellow. I always wanted to start my own company and Amida is it. When I have time I enjoy rock climbing and riding longboard.</p>

<p>Amida is my dream job.  I feel like I've been training for this my whole career, and now I get a chance to build a company, from the ground up, with the best people, a moral cause, and a huge market opportunity.  I know it sounds corny, but it is a pretty special privilege - and enormous good fortune - to even have the opportunity.   Game on!  Join us, and you will completely "get it".</p>

<h3>Matt McCall</h3>


<p>Venice Beach, CA</p>

<p>I love hacking on healthcare and get a chance to do that every day at Amida.  Before Amida, I was a Presidential Innovation Fellow working on Blue Button for America.  I also helped start and worked for OSEHRA, a not-for-profit designed to drive open-source HIT in government and industry.  In my spare time, I do improv, play ice hockey, and fix up old bicycles.  I also love to travel to new places, preferably somewhere I don't speak the language and might not have plumbing.  I'm originally from Maryland, but now live in Venice Beach, LA, where I eat Kale and complain about the weather when it dips below 60 like a proper Californian.</p>

<h3>Rachel Lunsford</h3>

<p>I only do things I'm passionate about - and health is hugely important because without it, what do you really have? While I'm considered employee number one, as a person with a chronic disease, I also like to call myself patient number one - that's how passionate I am. Before joining Amida, I spent time working for the Iowa Medicaid Enterprise learning and managing the ins and outs of Meaningful Use. And I had the joy and privilege to be part of the first implementation of the Blue Button at the VA.  When I'm not living, breathing, thinking, eating, and sleeping healthcare, I like to make and share cookies, build neat things out of Legos, and hang out with my awesome husband, Chris, and amazing lab mix, Rosie.</p>
