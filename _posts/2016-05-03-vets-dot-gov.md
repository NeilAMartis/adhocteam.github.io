U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs awards vets.gov contract to team led by Ad Hoc LLC
======================================================================================

For immediate release: May 3, 2016

**Silver Spring, MD:** The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today [announced the award](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=7f8a468f41a6a5c40b61ea599ecd3ab3&tab=core&tabmode=list&=) of a contract to a team of technology vendors led by [Ad Hoc LLC](https://adhocteam.us/), to design, develop, and operate [vets.gov](https://www.vets.gov/). Vets.gov is a new veterans-centered website that will consolidate all of VA’s existing services in to a single, self-service user experience. Veterans will be able to access all of VA’s information, benefits, and services from one site, with one login, all with a cohesive design organized around their needs.

Joining Ad Hoc on the contract are [The So Company](http://www.thesocompany.com/), a team of widely-published Veteran content writers who understand Veteran needs from first-hand experience; [ID.me](https://www.id.me/), a technology company with an Identity and Access Management platform built by Veterans to solve digital access challenges for the Veteran community; and [Accenture Federal Services](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/afs-industry-index.aspx), a global technology consulting firm and long-time partner of VA.

A team including the digital services group at VA and Ad Hoc first [launched](https://www.vets.gov/2015/11/11/why-we-are-designing-in-beta.html) vets.gov on Veterans Day 2015 as a beta site. They built and deployed it in just a few short months, using modern, best-practice software design and development methods.

"We're pleased to continue our work with VA on vets.gov. We're focused on the needs of Veterans. They deserve the conveniences of modern software, and that delivers good value to the taxpayer," said Greg Gershman, co-founder and principal of Ad Hoc.

Ad Hoc is a small software company. Ad Hoc's talented team of software engineers and designers have backgrounds in the private sector, including startups. They are experienced in building high-traffic, well-designed web applications with great user experiences. Gershman and his Ad Hoc co-founder Paul Smith were part of the "Tech Surge" that [rescued HealthCare.gov](/about/healthcare.gov-rescue.html) after its failed initial launch in the fall of 2013. *Time* magazine [featured](http://time.com/10228/obamas-trauma-team/) the story of the rescue in a cover article by Steven Brill.
