          Greg is an experienced software developer and entrepreneur. Greg’s career has included work in both government contracting and startups. In 2003, Greg founded his first company, Blogdigger, one of the first blog search engines. In 2012, Greg became one of the inaugural Presidential Innovation Fellows, working with the White House and General Services Administration on Project MyUSA, a platform for citizen-centric government applications. In mid-October of 2013, Greg was part of the “tech surge” that was brought in to fix HealthCare.gov after its troubled launch. Greg’s experience with HealthCare.gov, as well as his passion for helping government improve how it approaches IT projects, led him to co-found Ad Hoc LLC, a software consultancy aimed at changing how government does technology.

          Paul Smith is a software engineer who has been developing applications professionally for more than 15 years. In October 2013, the White House asked him to join the so-called "tech surge" team to assess the troubled HealthCare.gov launch. Over the next several months, he worked with the team to turn around the site to where it could sign up over 8 million Americans for private health insurance plans. He led teams in fixing critical bugs and developing and deploying a demand management queuing strategy. He was the deputy director of technology for the <abbr title="Democratic National Committee">DNC</abbr> during the re-election campaign of President Barack Obama in 2012. He’s been a part of several technology startups, including as co-founder of the pioneering hyperlocal news website, EveryBlock.com, where he developed a custom web mapping solution. EveryBlock sold to msnbc.com in 2009. He lives in Chicago with his wife and two children.
